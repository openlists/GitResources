## Overview

Using version control is an important skill for any software-driven work. 
One of the most common approaches for version control is to use git & Github. 
Here, we collect open tutorials and resources for learning git & Github. 

As a very brief overview / cheat-sheet:
- version control: is a _system_ for managing files, keeping track of changes and different versions
- git: is an open-source _tool_ for doing version control
- github: is a _place_ (basically, a database), that uses git. Github is a privately owned service
